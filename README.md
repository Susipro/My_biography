# My_biography

Important things about my life, things I like and personal skills.


## About me

I am a positive and happy girlhardworking girl, I like to enjoy the simple things in life, socialize with friends and family whenever I can and I love movies of any genre.

I have worked as a Painter, Teleoperator, Administrative, and Driving School Teacher and I liked them.

I am currently a Full Stack Programming Student of the company Factoria F5.

I had never studied programming until the beginning of this bootcamp.

A programming bootcamp is an intensive training that allows you, in a short time, to reach a very high level of knowledge in a specific subject.

In this bootcamp we carry out real projects, both individually and as a team. I have also participated in another team project in a Hackathon.
